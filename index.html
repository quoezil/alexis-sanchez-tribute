              <p class="player-descr-first player-descr"><span class="descr-highlight">Alexis Alejandro Sánchez Sánchez</span> (Spanish pronunciation: [aˈleksis ˈsantʃes]; born 19 December 1988), also known as simply Alexis, is a Chilean professional footballer who plays as a forward for English
                club Arsenal and the Chilean national team.</p>
              <p class="player-descr">After his debut season of first-team football with Cobreloa, Sánchez was signed by Italy's Udinese Calcio in 2006. Following successful loans at Colo-Colo and River Plate, he began playing in Serie A. In 2011, he was signed by Barcelona
                for £25 million, becoming the most expensive transfer in Chilean football history.[7] Sánchez signed for Arsenal in July 2014 for a fee reported to be £31.7 million, making him the third-most expensive signing in the club's history after
                Mesut Özil and Granit Xhaka.</p>
              <p class="player-descr">Sánchez has been a full international for Chile since 2006, and has earned 100 caps, making him the team's second-most capped player of all time after goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. With 34 goals, he is their third top scorer of all time. He
                played in two FIFA World Cups (2010 and 2014) as well as three Copa América tournaments, winning two of the latter.</p>
